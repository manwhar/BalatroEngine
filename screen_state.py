"""
Coarse screen-state tracker for template gating in `main.py`.

Maintains a conservative state machine over Balatro's visible UI screens so frame
scanning only evaluates templates that can legitimately appear and be clicked in
the current screen state. Starting mid-run is out of scope: tracking starts at
run initialization / Ante 1 (`PRE_GAME`).
