"""
Tests for Blueprint & Brainstorm compatibility rules and copying mechanics.

Validates:
1. Exact 1:1 parity with Balatro game source (121 compatible, 29 incompatible jokers).
2. Copy target resolution for Blueprint (right neighbor) and Brainstorm (leftmost).
3. Recursive chaining (Blueprint -> Brainstorm -> Target) and cycle protection.
4. Functional behavior during dispatch_jokers (e.g. Burnt Joker double-level, Burglar double-hands).
5. Protection against illegal scaling duplication on accumulator jokers.

Usage:
    python testing/test_blueprint_compat.py
